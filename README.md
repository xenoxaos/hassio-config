# Home Assistant (hass.io) Configuration by [@rrubin0]
[Hass.io](https://home-assistant.io/hassio) is the latest development from the Home Assistant [Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/)

This repo is for sharing my Home Assistant Configuration after my migration to Hass.io

# My Setup
My Home Assistant setup is running on an [ASUS Chromebox](https://www.asus.com/us/Chrome-Devices/Chromebox/) running Ubuntu Server 16.04. This tutorial gives a great explanation of how to get Ubuntu running on the Chromebox which is an ideal platform for hass.io ith no immediate need to deviate from the stock components. 

Additionally, I am using the [Aeon Labs Z-Wave Stick (Gen 5)](http://amzn.to/2id0EsA) to control my z-wave devices.
